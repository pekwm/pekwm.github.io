<h1 id="an-overview-of-pekwm">An overview of pekwm</h1>
<p>pekwm is a fast, functional, and flexible window manager which aims to
be usable, even without a mouse.</p>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-pekwm">An Introduction to pekwm</h2>
<p>pekwm, a window manager written by Claes Nästén, was once based on
the aewm++ window manager, but has since evolved enough that it no
longer resembles aewm++ at all. pekwm also has an expanded feature-set,
including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), auto
properties, Xinerama support and keygrabber that supports keychains,
and much more.</p>
<h3 id="why-pekwm?">Why pekwm?</h3>
<p>"Why make another window manager?", some ask. I say,"Why not?". Some of you may
argue that it's better to have a single standard desktop environment, so that
our mothers can find their way around, but in all honesty, if most of us wanted
the same environment as our mothers, we probably wouldn't be reading this
anyway. The same can also be applied to your sister, your roommate, your wife,
even your cat...</p>
<p>"Why should I use pekwm?", others may ask. Well, you don't have to! However, we
use it, and you're welcome to try it out as well. As always,you should use the
environment most suited to you. For a more comprehensive answer to this
question, check out the <a href="#pekwm-features">pekwm Features</a> section below.</p>
<h3 id="pekwm-features">pekwm Features</h3>
<p>Here's a short list of some of the features included in pekwm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possibility to group windows in a single frame</li>
<li>Configurable keygrabber that supports keychains</li>
<li>Configurable mouse actions</li>
<li>Configurable root- and window-menus and keybindings for all menus</li>
<li>Dynamic menus that regenerate on every view from a script output</li>
<li>Multi-screen support both via RandR and Xinerama</li>
<li>Configurable window placement</li>
<li>Theming support with images, shaping and configurable buttons.</li>
<li>Autoproperties (Automatic properties such as a window's sticky state, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-pekwm">Getting pekwm</h2>
<p>Now that you've decided to try it out, you need to know how to get it, for which
there are two options. The first is to download and compile the source, and the
second is finding a pre-compiled package.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-pekwm-source">Getting the pekwm source</h3>
<p>The source code is available from Github at <a href="https://github.com/pekdon/pekwm">https://github.com/pekdon/pekwm</a>.</p>
<p>Release tabralls are named pekwm-0.2.0.tar.gz and
pekwm-0.2.0.tar.bz2. Although it doesn't matter which you get, keep in
mind that the .bz2 is smaller in comparison.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, pekwm from GIT is stable enough for everyday use and should,
in most cases, be a safe bet to get all the latest functionality.</p>
<h3 id="getting-prebuilt-pekwm-packages">Getting prebuilt pekwm packages</h3>
<p>pekwm is available as a package on many Linux and BSD distributions,
for further details, refer to your distribution.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-pekwm">Compiling pekwm</h2>
<p>This chapter will help you compile pekwm.</p>
<h3 id="unpacking-the-archive">Unpacking the Archive</h3>
<p>The first step to compiling pekwm is to unpack the archive. Unpacking
depends on which version you downloaded:</p>

<pre>tar -zxvf pekwm-0.2.0.tar.gz
tar -zjvf pekwm-0.2.0.tar.bz2
</pre>
<blockquote><p>The '-j' option works normally on most linux systems, and as of the
current GNU tar development version, is part of GNU tar. If your
system does not support the -j option, you can use two things:
<strong>bzip2 -dc pekwm-0.2.0.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -</strong> or <strong>bzip2 -d
pekwm-0.2.0.tar.bz2</strong> followed by <strong>tar -xvf pekwm-0.2.0.tar</strong>. This
also works for the .tar.gz version using <strong>gzip -dc</strong> or <strong>gzip
-d</strong>.</p>
</blockquote><p>The 'v' options are elective, they show you the filenames as they're
being extracted. At this point, you should have a pekwm-0.2.0
directory. Use <strong>cd pekwm-0.2.0</strong> to get there.</p>
<h3 id="installing-build-dependencies">Installing build dependencies</h3>
<p>Before building pekwm a C++ compiler with support for C++11 needs to
be available on the system, the CMake build system and a set of X11
and image libraries.</p>
<p>The sections below describe how to install the required packages for
different OSes and Linux distributions.</p>
<h4 id="alpine">Alpine</h4>
<p>Development tools using the GCC C++ compiler:</p>

<pre># apk add cmake g++ make
</pre>
<p>Build dependencies:</p>

<pre># apk add fontconfig-dev jpeg-dev libxext-dev libpng-dev libxft-dev libxpm-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev
</pre>
<h4 id="debian">Debian</h4>
<p>Development tools using the GCC C++ compiler:</p>

<pre># apt install cmake g++ make
</pre>
<p>Build dependencies:</p>

<pre># apt install libfontconfig1-dev libjpeg-dev libxext-dev libpng-dev libxft-dev libxpm-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev
</pre>
<h4 id="void">Void</h4>
<p>Development tools using the GCC C++ compiler:</p>

<pre># xbps-install cmake make gcc
</pre>
<p>Build dependencies:</p>

<pre># xbps-install fontconfig-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel libXext-devel libpng-devel libXft-devel libXpm-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel
</pre>
<h4 id="openbsd">OpenBSD</h4>
<p>OpenBSD comes with X11 and a compatible C++ compiler. To add the
required packages run:</p>

<pre># pkg_add cmake jpeg png
</pre>
<h4 id="os-x-(homebrew)">OS X (homebrew)</h4>
<p>OS X does not come with a X11 installation by default, so
<a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">XQuartz</a> needs to be installed first.</p>
<p>The development tools are not installed by default but can be
installed using the following command:</p>

<pre>xcode-select --install
</pre>
<p>Assuming homebrew is installed, the only package required to build
pekwm after install XQuartz and the development tools is CMake:</p>

<pre>$ brew install cmake
</pre>
<h3 id="setting-up-a-build-directory">Setting up a build directory</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to setup a build directory and configure
pekwm using CMake:</p>

<pre>mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
</pre>
<p>Pekwm support a few configuration options, each option is specified on
the cmake command line as:</p>

<pre>-DOPTION=ON
</pre>

<h3 id="building-and-installing">Building and installing</h3>
<p>After running cmake with any configuration options you need, run <strong>make</strong>.
This should only take a few minutes. After that, become root (unless you
used a prefix in your home directory, such as
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/you/pkg) and type <strong>make install</strong></p>
<p>Adding <strong>exec pekwm</strong> to ~/.xinitrc if you start X running <strong>startx</strong>
or ~/.xsession if you use a display manager should usually be enough
to get pekwm running.</p>
<p>That's it! pekwm is installed on your computer now. Next you should
read the <a href="basic-usage.html#getting-started">Getting Started</a> chapter.</p>
