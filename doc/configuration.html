<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>The configuration part of this documentation is focused on providing
complete documentation for all config files located in your ~/.pekwm
directory.</p>

<h2 id="the-pekwm-common-syntax-for-config-files">The pekwm Common Syntax for Config Files</h2>
<h3 id="basic-syntax">Basic Syntax</h3>
<p>All pekwm config files (with the exception of the start file- see
<a href="#the-pekwm-start-file">start file</a> ) follow a common syntax for options.</p>

<pre># comment
// another comment
/*
    yet another comment
*/

$VARIABLE = "Value"
$_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE = "Value"
INCLUDE = "another_configuration.cfg"
COMMAND = "program to execute and add the valid config syntax it outputs here"

# Normal format
Section = "Name" {
    Event = "Param" {
        Actions = "action parameter; action parameter; $VAR $_VARIABLE"
    }
}

// Compressed format
Section = "Name" { Event = "Param" { Actions = "action parameters; action parameters; $VAR $_VARIABLE" } }
</pre>
<p>One can usually modify the spacing and line breaks, but this is the
"Correct" format, so the documentation will try to stick to it.</p>
<p>Events can be combined into the same line by issuing a semicolon
between them. Actions can be combined into the same user action by
issuing a semicolon between them. You can use an INCLUDE anywhere in
the file.</p>
<p>pekwm has a vars file to set common variables between config
files. Variables are defined in vars and the file is INCLUDEd from the
configuration files.</p>
<p>Comments are allowed in all config files, by starting a comment line
with # or //, or enclosing the comments inside /* and */.</p>
<h3 id="template-syntax">Template Syntax</h3>
<p>The pekwm configuration parser supports the use of templates to reduce
typing. Template support is currently available in autoproperties and
theme configuration files. Template configuration is not fully
compatible with the non-template syntax and thus requires activation
to not break backwards compatibility. To enable template parsing, start
the configuration file with the following:</p>

<pre>Require {
    Templates = "True"
}
</pre>
<p>Defining templates is just like creating an ordinary section; however it uses
the special name Define. Below is an example defining a template named
NAME:</p>

<pre>Define = "NAME" {
  Section = "Sub" {
    ValueSub = "Sub Value"
  }
  Value = "Value"
}
</pre>
<p>The above defined template can later be used by using the magic
character @. The below example shows usage of the template NAME in a
two sections named Name and NameOverride overriding one of the
template values:</p>

<pre>Section = "Name" {
  @NAME
}
Section = "NameOverride" {
  @NAME
  Value = "Overridden value"
}
</pre>
<p>The above example is equivalent of writing the following:</p>

<pre>Section = "Name" {
  Section = "Sub" {
    ValueSub = "Sub Value"
  }
  Value = "Value"
}
Section = "Name" {
  Section = "Sub" {
    ValueSub = "Sub Value"
  }
  Value = "Overridden"
}
</pre>
<h3 id="variables-in-pekwm-config-files">Variables In pekwm Config Files</h3>
<p>pekwm config enables you to use both internal to pekwm variables, as
well as global system variables. Internal variables are prefixed with
a <strong>$</strong>, global variables with <strong>$_</strong>.</p>

<pre># examples of how to set both type of variables
$INTERNAL = "this is an internal variable"
$_GLOBAL = "this is a global variable"

# examples of how to read both type of variables
RootMenu = "Menu" {
    Entry = "$_GLOBAL" { Actions = "xmessage $INTERNAL" }
}
</pre>
<p>There is one special global variable pekwm handles. It is called
$_PEKWM_CONFIG_FILE. This global variable is read when pekwm
starts, and it's contents will be used as the default config file. It
will also be updated to point to the currently active config file if
needed.</p>
<p>A few other variables defined by pekwm:</p>
<ul>
<li>$_PEKWM_ETC_PATH points to the system configuration directory,
set at compile time. This is usually /etc.</li>
<li>$_PEKWM_SCRIPT_PATH points to the "scripts" directory of pekwm,
e.g. /usr/share/pekwm/scripts.</li>
<li>$_PEKWM_THEME_PATH points to the "themes" directory of pekwm,
e.g. /usr/share/pekwm/themes.</li>
<li>$_PEKWM_CONFIG_PATH contains the directory path of
$_PEKWM_CONFIG_FILE</li>
</ul>
<p>Variables can probably be defined almost anywhere, but it's probably a
better idea to place them at the top of the file, outside of any
sections.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-config-file">The main config file</h2>
<p>The main config file is where all the base config stuff goes.</p>
<h3 id="basic-config">Basic Config</h3>

<h3 id="screen-subsections">Screen Subsections</h3>
<p>There are two subsections in the screen section - Placement and
UniqueNames. Placement can optionally have its own subsection. Sound
hard? It's really not! It's actually quite simple.</p>
<p>We'll start off with Placement. Placement has two options: Model, and
a 'Smart' subsection. Model is very simple, it's simply a list of
keywords that describes how to place new windows, such as "Smart
MouseCentered". Secondly, there's a Smart section, which describes how
pekwm computes where to place a new window in smart mode.</p>
<p>The second subsection, UniqueNames, lets you configure how pekwm
should handle similar client names. pekwm can add unique number
identifiers to clients that have the same title so that instead of
"terminal" and "terminal", you would end up with something like
"terminal" and "terminal [2]".</p>
<h2 id="configuring-the-menus">Configuring the menus</h2>
<p>The root menu is what you get when you (by default- See the <a href="actions.html#actions">Mouse
Bindings</a> section) left-click on the root window
(also called the desktop). You can also configure the window menu,
which you get when you right-click on a window title.</p>
<h3 id="basic-menu-syntax">Basic Menu Syntax</h3>
<p>As previously indicated, the root and window menus follow the rules
defined in <a href="#common-syntax">Common Syntax</a>. There aren't many possible
options, and they're all either within the main menu, or within a
submenu. This is all handled by a single file.</p>
<p>As an addition to the default menu types, RootMenu and WindowMenu, a user
can define any number of new menus following the same syntax.</p>
<p>Here's an example ~/.pekwm/menu file, where we have the usual RootMenu
and WindowMenu and our own most used applications menu called
MyOwnMenuName:</p>

<pre># Menu config for pekwm

# Variables
$TERM = "xterm -fn fixed +sb -bg black -fg white"

RootMenu = "pekwm" {
    Entry = "Term" { Actions = "Exec $TERM" }
    Entry = "Emacs" { Icon = "emacs.png"; Actions = "Exec $TERM -title emacs -e emacs -nw" }
    Entry = "Vim" { Actions = "Exec $TERM -title vim -e vi" }

    Separator {}

    Submenu = "Utils" {
        Entry = "XCalc" { Actions = "Exec xcalc" }
        Entry = "XMan" { Actions = "Exec xman" }
    }

    Separator {}

    Submenu = "pekwm" {
        Entry = "Reload" { Actions = "Reload" }

</pre>
<h3 id="menu-keywords">Menu Keywords</h3>
<p>Here are the different elements that can be used in your root menu file.</p>
<p><strong>Root Menu Elements:</strong></p>
<p>Submenu (Name)</p>
<p>Begins a submenu. 'name' is what will appear in the root menu for the entry.</p>
<p>Entry (Name)</p>
<p>Begins a menu entry. 'Name' is the text shown in the menu for this entry.</p>
<p>Actions (Action)</p>
<p>Run an action. 'Action' is the action(s) to run. Most actions listed
in <a href="actions.html#actions">Keys/mouse actions</a> will also work from the
root and window menus.</p>
<p>Icon (Image)</p>
<p>Set icon left of entry from image in icon path.</p>
<p>Separator</p>
<p>Adds a separator to the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Menu Actions:</strong></p>
<p>Exec</p>
<p>Exec makes pekwm execute the command that follows it.</p>
<p>Reload</p>
<p>When this is called, pekwm will re-read all configuration files without exiting.</p>
<p>Restart</p>
<p>This will cause pekwm to exit and re-start completely.</p>
<p>RestartOther</p>
<p>Quits pekwm and starts another application. The application to run is given as a parameter.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Exits pekwm. Under a normal X setup, This will end your X session.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to these, many actions found from <a href="actions.html#actions">Keys/mouse
actions</a> also work.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="custom-menus">Custom Menus</h3>
<p>User can also define an unlimited amount of custom menus. They are
called with the ShowMenu action much like the Root and Window menus
are (see <a href="actions.html#actions">Keys/mouse actions</a>).</p>
<p>In the example menu on this documentation, we created your own menu,
called 'MyOwnMenuName'. Basically, outside of the RootMenu and
WindowMenu sections, we open our own section called
'MyOwnMenuName'. This can of course be called whatever you want it to
be called, but do note that the menu names are case insensitive. This
means you can't have one menu called 'MyMostUsedApps' and one called
'mymostusedapps'.</p>
<p>Lets see that example again, simplified:</p>

<pre>RootMenu = "pekwm" { ... }
WindowMenu = "Window Menu" { ... }
MyOwnMenuName = "Most used apps" {
    Entry = "Term" { Actions = "Exec $TERM" }
    Entry = "XCalc" { Actions = "Exec xcalc" }
    Entry = "Dillo" { Actions = "Exec dillo" }
}
</pre>
<p>We would call this new menu using the action 'ShowMenu MyOwnMenuName',
The menu would show 'Most used apps' as the menu title and list
'Term', 'XCalc' and 'Dillo' in the menu ready to be executed.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-menus">Dynamic Menus</h3>
<p>It is possible to use dynamic menus in pekwm, that is menus that
regenerate themselves whenever the menu is viewed. This is done with
the Dynamic keyword.</p>
<p>To use this feature, you need to put a dynamic entry in the
~/.pekwm/menu file with a parameter that tells pekwm what file to
execute to get the menu. This file can be of any language you prefer,
the main thing is that it outputs valid pekwm menu syntax inside a
Dynamic {} section. The syntax of dynamic entry looks like this:</p>

<pre>Entry = "" { Actions = "Dynamic /path/to/filename" }
</pre>
<p>The input from a program that creates the dynamic content should
follow the general menu syntax encapsulated inside a Dynamic {}
section. Variables have to be included inside the dynamic menu for
them to work. A simple script to give pekwm dynamic menu content would
look like this:</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash
output=$RANDOM # gets a random number

echo "Dynamic {"
echo " Entry = \"$output\" { Actions = \"Exec xmessage $output\" }"
echo "}"

This script would output something like:

Dynamic {
 Entry = "31549" { Actions = "Exec xmessage 31549" }
}
</pre>
<p>Clients can access the PID and Window that was active when the script
was executed via the environment variables $CLIENT_PID and
$CLIENT_WINDOW. $CLIENT_PID is only available if the client is being
run on the same host as pekwm.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-and-mouse-configuration">Keyboard and Mouse Configuration</h2>
<p>pekwm allows you to remap almost all keyboard and mouse events.</p>
<h3 id="mouse-bindings">Mouse Bindings</h3>
<p>The pekwm Mousebindings go in ~/.pekwm/mouse, and are very
simple. They're divided up into two groups: The 'where' and
'event'. Below is an example file:</p>

</pre>
<p>Below you will find, the different fields defined. The actions themselves can be
found in the <a href="actions.html#actions">Keys/mouse actions</a> section.</p>
<p><strong>'Where' fields:</strong></p>
<p>FrameTitle</p>
<p>On a regular window's Titlebar.</p>
<p>OtherTitle</p>
<p>On menu/cmdDialog/etc pekwm's own window's Titlebar.</p>
<p>Border</p>
<p>On the window's borders. See <a href="#mouse-only-actions">Border Subsection</a> for more information.</p>
<p>ScreenEdge</p>
<p>On the screen edges. See <a href="#mouse-only-actions">ScreenEdge Subsection</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Client</p>
<p>Anywhere on the window's interior. It's best to use a keyboard modifier with these.</p>
<p>Root</p>
<p>On the Root window (also called the 'desktop').</p>
<p>Menu</p>
<p>On the various menus excluding their titlebars.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>On everything else that doesn't have its own section.</p>
<p><strong>'Event' fields:</strong></p>
<p>ButtonPress</p>
<p>A single click</p>
<p>ButtonRelease</p>
<p>A single click that activates once the button is released</p>
<p>DoubleClick</p>
<p>A double click</p>
<p>Motion</p>
<p>Clicking, holding, and Dragging.</p>
<p>Enter</p>
<p>Defines how to act when mouse pointer enters a place defined by the 'where' field.</p>
<p>Leave</p>
<p>Defines how to act when mouse pointer leaves a place defined by the 'where' field.</p>
<p>EnterMoving</p>
<p>Defines how to act when a dragged window enters a ScreenEdge. Only works with screen edges.</p>
<p>Definitions work like this:</p>

<pre>'Where' {
    'Event' = "optional modifiers, like mod1, ctrl, etc and a mouse button" {
        Actions = "actions and their parameters"
    }
    'Event' = "optional modifiers, like mod1, ctrl, etc and a mouse button" {
        Actions = "actions and their parameters"
    }
}
</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Additional notes.</strong></p>
<p>Modifiers and mouse buttons can be defined as "Any" which is useful
for Enter and Leave events. Any also applies as none. Motion events
have a threshold argument; this is the number of pixels you must
drag your mouse before they begin to work. Multiple actions can be
defined for a single user action. Example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>Motion = "1" { Actions = "Move"; Treshold = "3" }
ButtonPress = "1" { Actions = "Raise; ActivateClient" }
</pre>
<h3 id="border-subsection">Border Subsection</h3>
<p>The Border subsection in ~/.pekwm/mouse defines the actions to take
when handling the window borders.</p>

<pre>Border {
    TopLeft {
        Enter = "Any Any" { Actions = "Focus" }
        ButtonPress = "1" { Actions = "Resize TopLeft" }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>It's subsections refer to the frame part in question. They are: Top,
Bottom, Left, Right, TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft, and
BottomRight. In these subsections you can define events and actions as
usual.</p>
<h3 id="screenedge-subsection">ScreenEdge Subsection</h3>
<p>The ScreenEdge subsection in ~/.pekwm/mouse defines the actions to
take when an event happens on the specified screenedge.</p>

<pre>ScreenEdge {
    Left {
        Enter = "Mod1 Any" { Actions = "GoToWorkspace Left" }
        ButtonPress = "3" { Actions = "ShowMenu Root" }
        ButtonPress = "1" { Actions = "GoToWorkspace Left" }
        ButtonPress = "2" { Actions = "ShowMenu Goto" }
        ButtonPress = "4" { Actions = "GoToWorkspace Right" }
        ButtonPress = "5" { Actions = "GoToWorkspace Left" }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>It has four subsections: Up, Down, Left, and Right, that all refer to
the screen edge in question. In these subsections you can give events
and actions as usual.</p>
<h3 id="key-bindings">Key Bindings</h3>
<p>The pekwm keybindings go in ~/.pekwm/keys, and are even more simple
than the mouse bindings. Here's the format:</p>

<pre>KeyPress = "optional modifiers like mod1, ctrl, etc and the key" {
    Actions = "action and the parameters for the action, if they are needed"
}
</pre>
<p>Multiple actions can be drawn from one keypress. The actions are
separated from each other with a semicolon:</p>

<pre>Keypress = "Ctrl t" { Actions = "Exec xterm; Set Maximized True True; Close" }
</pre>
<p>Here's a small fragment of an example keys file; you can see a full
version in ~/.pekwm/keys. As with the mouse, you can see the full list
of actions in the <a href="actions.html#actions">Keys/mouse actions</a>
section.</p>

<pre>Global {
    # Moving in frames
    KeyPress = "Mod1 Tab" { Actions = "NextFrame EndRaise" }
    KeyPress = "Mod1 Shift Tab" { Actions = "PrevFrame EndRaise" }
    KeyPress = "Mod1 Ctrl Tab" { Actions = "NextFrameMRU EndRaise" }
    KeyPress = "Mod1 Ctrl Shift Tab" { Actions = "PrevFrameMRU EndRaise" }
    # Simple window management
    KeyPress = "Mod4 M" { Actions = "Toggle Maximized True True" }
    KeyPress = "Mod4 G" { Actions = "Maxfill True True" }
    KeyPress = "Mod4 F" { Actions = "Toggle FullScreen" }
    KeyPress = "Mod4 Return" { Actions = "MoveResize" }
    # Wm actions
    Chain = "Ctrl Mod4 P" {
        KeyPress = "Delete" { Actions = "Reload" }
        KeyPress = "Next" { Actions = "Restart" }
        KeyPress = "End" { Actions = "Exit" }
        KeyPress = "Prior" { Actions = "RestartOther twm" }
    }
}

MoveResize {
    KeyPress = "Left" { Actions = "MoveHorizontal -10" }
    KeyPress = "Right" { Actions = "MoveHorizontal 10" }
    KeyPress = "Up" { Actions = "MoveVertical -10" }
    KeyPress = "Down" { Actions = "MoveVertical 10" }
    Keypress = "Mod4 Left" { Actions = "ResizeHorizontal -10" }
    Keypress = "Mod4 Right" { Actions = "ResizeHorizontal 10" }
    Keypress = "Mod4 Up" { Actions = "ResizeVertical -10" }
    Keypress = "Mod4 Down" { Actions = "ResizeVertical 10" }
    Keypress = "s" { Actions = "MoveSnap" }
    Keypress = "Escape" { Actions = "Cancel" }
    Keypress = "Return" { Actions = "End" }
}

Menu {
    KeyPress = "Down" { Actions = "NextItem" }
    KeyPress = "Up" { Actions = "PrevItem" }
    KeyPress = "Left" { Actions = "LeaveSubmenu" }
    KeyPress = "Right" { Actions = "EnterSubmenu" }
    KeyPress = "Return" { Actions = "Select" }
    KeyPress = "Escape" { Actions = "Close" }
}

InputDialog {
    KeyPress = "BackSpace" { Actions = "Erase" }
    KeyPress = "Right" { Actions = "CursNext" }
    KeyPress = "Left" { Actions = "CursPrev" }
    KeyPress = "Up" { Actions = "HistPrev" }
    KeyPress = "Down" { Actions = "HistNext" }
    KeyPress = "Delete" { Actions = "Clear" }
    KeyPress = "Return" { Actions = "Exec" }
    KeyPress = "Escape" { Actions = "Close" }
    KeyPress = "Any Any" { Actions = "Insert" }
}
</pre>
<p>As you might have noticed, the file consist of four sections. These
sections are Global, MoveResize, Menu and InputDialog. The first
section, Global, contains all the generic actions.</p>
<p>The MoveResize section has the keybindings that will get used when the
MoveResize action is called.</p>
<p>Menu section contains the keys that are used when the ShowMenu action
is called. E.g. these are the keys you use to browse thru the menus of
pekwm. Note that while ShowMenu is active, the Global keybindings are
also listened. If a keybinding is same in both Menu and Global
sections, keybindings in Menu section override the global keybinding
as long as a menu is active.</p>
<p>Finally, the InputDialog section allow for tuning of what keys are
available for line editing when the CmdDialog window that enables the
user to enter pekwm actions for running windows is active.</p>
<p>Keys can be identified with their XString name or with their
keycode. Both can be found out using the X application <strong>xev</strong>. If you
want to use a keycode, prefix it with <strong>#</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="keychains">Keychains</h3>
<p>pekwm also supports keychains. Keychain syntax follows the general
config syntax and looks like this:</p>

<pre>Chain = "modifiers and key" {
    Chain = "modifiers and key" {
        KeyPress = "modifiers and key" { Actions = "actions and their parameters" }
    }
    Keypress = "modifiers and key" { Actions = "actions and their parameters" }
}
</pre>
<p>It might seem complicated at start but once you look into it, it is
fairly nice and logical. This syntax supports as many nested Chains as
you might want.</p>
<p>Now for some examples. Here we have a simple nested chain that lets
you press Ctrl+Alt+M, then M, then M, V or H to toggle maximized
attribute into Full/Vertical or Horizontal, and a simpler one level
chain that brings up the root menu.</p>

<pre>Chain = "Ctrl Mod4 A" {
    Chain = "M" {
        KeyPress = "M" { Actions = "Toggle Maximized True True" }
        KeyPress = "V" { Actions = "Toggle Maximized False True" }
        KeyPress = "H" { Actions = "Toggle Maximized True False" }
    }
}
Chain = "Ctrl Mod4 M" {
    KeyPress = "R" { Actions = "ShowMenu Root" }
}
</pre>
<p>This next rule is a pure show-off, it lets you type in 'test' and then
executes xterm. Note that this will make you unable to type the
character 't' to any programs.</p>

<pre>Chain = "t" { Chain = "e" { Chain = "s" {
    Keypress = "t" { Actions = "Exec xterm" }
} } }
</pre>
<p><a href="actions.html">Actions</a></p>
<h2 id="the-pekwm-start-file">The pekwm start file</h2>
<p>The ~/.pekwm/start file is the simplest of all of pekwm's config
files. It's a simple shell script that's run on pekwm
startup. Therefore, to run, it needs to be set executable with <strong>chmod
+x ~/.pekwm/start</strong>.</p>
<p>Why would anyone use start rather than just use their ~/.xinitrc file?
Well, the answer is, the start file is executed during the pekwm
initialization phase - therefore, it gets re-executed when you issue a
pekwm 'restart'.</p>
<p>Here's an example pekwm start file. Be careful to place long running
applications to the background, or you will seem stuck when trying to
start pekwm.</p>
