<h2 id="what-are-autoproperties?">What are Autoproperties?</h2>
<p>"Autoproperties" is short for "Automatic Properties". This is pekwm's
way of setting certain things up for applications based on the
window's internal id. You can set up a lot of things, such as size,
iconified state, start location, grouped state (automatically having
one window group to another), workspace to start on, whether it has a
border or titlebar, and more. It is also possible to automatically
modify window titles and to decide the order of applications on the
harbour with autoproperties.</p>
<h2 id="basic-autoproperties-syntax">Basic Autoproperties Syntax</h2>
<p>The ~/.pekwm/autoproperties file follows the rules in <a href="#common-syntax">Common
Syntax</a>. This file can become rather complicated, but
it's also the most powerful of any of pekwm's config files.</p>
<p>The one important thing to remember is the Property tag. This
identifier tells us where to apply properties; meaning which windows
to apply it on. To find out the two terms, use <strong>xprop WM_CLASS</strong> and
click on your window. Below you'll find a bash/zsh function which will
give you the correct string for this file. You can also specify a
regexp wildcard, such as ".*,opera", which means anything for the
first word, opera for the second.</p>

<pre>propstring () {
  echo -n 'Property '
  xprop WM_CLASS | sed 's/.*"\(.*\)", "\(.*\)".*/= "\1,\2" {/g'
  echo '}'
}
</pre>
<p>Autoproperties have both an old and new style matching clients. The
new style was introduced to support using configuration template
overwriting.</p>
<p>In addition with WM_CLASS, pekwm also can identify clients by their
title string (<strong>xprop WM_NAME</strong> or <strong>xprop _NET_WM_NAME</strong>).</p>

<pre># New syntax, requires Require { Templates = "True" }
Property = "^dillo,^Dillo,,Dillo: pekwm.org - not just another windowmanager" {
    ApplyOn = "Start New"
    Layer = "OnTop"
}

# Old syntax
Property = "^dillo,^Dillo" {
        Title = "Dillo: pekwm.org - not just another windowmanager"
    ApplyOn = "Start New"
    Layer = "OnTop"
}
</pre>
<p>Or by their role (<strong>xprop WM_WINDOW_ROLE</strong>):</p>

<pre># New syntax, requires Require { Templates = "True" }
Property = "^gaim,^Gaim,preferences" {
    ApplyOn = "New"
    Skip = "Menus"
}

# Old syntax
Property = "^gaim,^Gaim" {
    Role = "preferences"
    ApplyOn = "New"
    Skip = "Menus"
}
</pre>
<p>pekwm can rewrite window titles. This is done in a separate TitleRules
section, where one defines properties regarding which clients to use the
rewriting on and then a regexp rule of what to do to that clients
title. These rules do not affect the actual WM_NAME string. You can
use Role and Title keywords to narrow down the clients to whom the titlerule
applies. A simple rule that would change "Title: this is the title"
to "this is the title" looks like this:</p>

<pre>TitleRules {
    Property = "^foo,^bar" {
        Rule = "/Title: (.*)/\\1/"
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In pekwm, you can make certain windows have their own decoration
set. The different decorations are defined in the theme, and they are
connected to client windows with an autoproperty. These autoproperties
reside in their own DecorRules subsection and look like this:</p>

<pre>DecorRules {
    Property = "^foo,^bar" {
        Decor = "TERM"
    }
}
</pre>
<p>It's also possible to decide the order of applications that start in
the harbour. As with TitleRules and DecorRules, there is it's own
separate section for this purpose called Harbour. Position is a signed
int and order goes: "1 2 3 0 0 0 -3 -2 -1", and so on. That looked
cryptic. Not to worry. Basically, a Position number of 0 means the
application will be placed in the middle. If the number is positive,
the application will be placed before the zero-positioned
applications. If the number is negative, the applications will be
placed after the zero-position ones. So the positive numbered show up
first in your harbour, then the zero numbered, and after the zeros
come the negatively numbered applications. I hope this is clear, as the
next part is tricky.</p>
<p>The larger the value of the base number the
closer to the zero applications they will be. So the smaller the base
number the closer to the ends of the harbour the application will
be. Position 1 would be the first application to show up on the
harbour. And similarly Position -1 would be the last application on
the harbour. If you have application on the harbour that do not match
any of the property rules on the Harbour section, they will act as if
you had given them Position 0. Applications with the same Position
will show up next to each other in the order they are launched. In our
example below, obpager will always be placed the last on the harbour.</p>

<pre>Harbour {
    Property = "^obpager,^obpager" {
        Position = "-1";
    }
}
</pre>
<p>If you want certain autoproperties to be applied only when you are on
a specific workspace, you can add a workspace section. The following
example sets an autoproperty that removes the border and titlebar from
xterm on the second and third workspace. Please keep in mind that we
start counting with 0.</p>

<pre>Workspace = "1 2" {
    Property = "xterm,XTerm" {
        ApplyOn = "Start New Reload"
        Border = "False"
        Titlebar = "False"
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Here's an example ~/.pekwm/autoproperties file:</p>

<pre>Property = ".*,^xmms" {
    ApplyOn = "Start New"
    Layer = "0"
    Sticky = "True"
}

Property = "^xclock,^XClock" {
    ApplyOn = "Start New"
    FrameGeometry = "100x100+0-0"
    Border = "False"; Titlebar = "False"
    Sticky = "True"
    Layer = "Desktop"
}

Property = "^dillo,^Dillo" {
    ApplyOn = "Start New"
    Group = "browsers" {
        Size = "30"
        Behind = "True"
        Global = "False"
    }
}

TitleRules {
    Property = "^dillo,^Dillo" {
        Rule = "/Dillo: (.*)/\1 [dillo]/"
    }
    Property = "^opera,^opera" {
        Rule = "/...:... - (.*) - Opera .*/\\1 [opera]/"
    }
}

DecorRules {
    Property = "^.term,^XTerm" {
        Decor = "TERM"
    }
}

Harbour {
    Property = "^obpager,^obpager" {
        Position = "-1"
    }
}
</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Regular Expressions!</strong></p>
<p>The pekwm autoproperties file uses Regular Expression syntax for
wildcards. Regular expressions can be really confusing to people
with no experience with them. A good rule of thumb is: "Anywhere
you'd think to use '*', use '.*'". Also, '^' matches the beginning
of a string, '$' matches the end, and '.' is any single
character. Pekwm has some special flags that modify regular
expression matching. Specifying regular expressions in the form
/pattern/flags allow flags to be set. The supported flags are ! for
inverting the match and i for case insensitive matches. Explaining
the syntax of regular expressions goes beyond the scope of this
documentation. You might want to look at
<a href="http://www.regularexpressions.info/">http://www.regularexpressions.info/</a><a href="http://www.regularexpressions.info/"></a>

<h2 id="autogrouping">AutoGrouping</h2>
<p>Autogrouping is actually very simple, although it might be a bit
confusing at first. Group is an identifier, it's just a string, (in my
example, we'll call it netwin). Size tells how many clients to group
together in one frame.</p>
<p>The example: We want to autogroup Sylpheed and Opera together,
allowing as many instances of the program windows to be grouped as
there are. Here's the Autoprops section for that:</p>

<pre>Property = ".\*,^opera" {
    Group = "netwin" {
        Size = "0"
    }
    ApplyOn = "New Start Reload"
}
Property = ".\*,^Sylpheed" {
    Group = "netwin" {
        Size = "0"
    }
    ApplyOn = "New Start Reload Transient"
}
</pre>
<p>This creates two rules: "For any window matching '.*,^opera', group
these in the 'netwin' group. Apply this on pekwm start/reload and when
new windows matching this property are opened, but do not include
dialog windows", and "For any window matching '.*,^Sylpheed', group
in the 'netwin' group. Apply on pekwm start/reload and when new
windows matching this property are opened, also include possible
dialog windows to the group. Open the window to the group but do not
raise it automatically".</p>
<p>To group unlimited windows together, use size 0.</p>
<p>Also note that you can have as many Group identifiers as you
want. Autogrouping is a very flexible system. Try playing around with
it.</p>
<h2 id="typerules">TypeRules</h2>
<p>The TypeRules decides how the _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE should be
interpreted. The _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE hint gives the application
writer possibility to inform the window manager what kind of window it
is creating.</p>
<p>TypeRules are defined in the TypeRules section of the
~/.pekwm/autoproperties file. A sample section could look something
like this:</p>

<pre>TypeRules {
    ...

    Property = "MENU"  {
        Titlebar = "False"
        Border = "False"
        Skip = "FocusToggle Menus Snap"
    }

    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Using TypeRules are done the same way as with <a href="#advanced-autoproperties">Advanced
Autoproperrties</a> but the property is matched
based on the value of _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE. Supported values are
available in the list below.</p>
<p><strong>Supported values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Desktop</em>, A desktop window such as the window containing desktop icons on the Gnome desktop.</li>
<li><em>Dock</em></li>
<li><em>Toolbar</em></li>
<li><em>Menu</em></li>
<li><em>Utility</em></li>
<li><em>Splash</em>, Application startup screen usually presenting loading progress.</li>
<li><em>Dialog</em>, Dialogs prompting for information such as "Save as" dialogs.</li>
<li><em>Normal</em>, Any other window, can be used to set default autoproperties.</li>
</ul>
